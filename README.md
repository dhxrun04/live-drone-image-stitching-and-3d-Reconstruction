# live-drone-image-stitching-and-3d-Reconstruction
Developed a project on live image capturing and stitching to create a 3D map using the ZoeDepth algorithm.

üöÅ Project Overview:

This project involved capturing live images via drones and seamlessly stitching them together to create a detailed 3D map. By leveraging the ZoeDepth algorithm, we were able to achieve accurate depth perception and produce high-quality 3D representations of the environment.

üîç Key Highlights:

Advanced 3D Mapping: Created a comprehensive 3D map using real-time data captured by drones.

Innovative Use of ZoeDepth Algorithm: Enhanced depth perception and accuracy in mapping through cutting-edge algorithmic integration.

Practical Applications: The technology has potential uses in various fields such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management.

This project was a valuable experience that allowed me to apply my skills in computer vision and drone technology, pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in 3D mapping. I‚Äôm grateful for the guidance of Mrs. P.V. Kavitha throughout this journey.

I‚Äôm excited to continue exploring the intersection of AI, computer vision, and drone technology. Let‚Äôs connect if you‚Äôre interested in learning more or discussing potential collaborations!
